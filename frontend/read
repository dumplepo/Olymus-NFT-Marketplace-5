I'll create a comprehensive Web3 NFT Marketplace with a stunning Greek mythology theme featuring all the requested features: golden ratio cards, parallax effects, lightning animations, and a cinematic interface ready for smart contract integration.

Everything looks good! The application is now complete with all the requested features. Let me write a final summary:

Summary
I've successfully created a comprehensive Web3 NFT Marketplace interface with a stunning Greek mythology theme inspired by Olympus. The application features:

Landing Page: Cinematic fullscreen experience with parallax effects showing clouds and ancient temples, divine greeting text, site introduction, contact information (+1 (888) OLYMPUS), and a smooth transition to the main application with lightning effects.

Main Application includes:

Wallet Connection: Status bar with connect/disconnect functionality
My NFTs Section: Manage owned NFTs with Sell, Transfer, and Auction actions
Marketplace: Browse and purchase NFTs with search and price filters
Collections: Explore all NFTs categorized as Gods, Titans, Heroes, Creatures, and Artifacts
Auctions: Real-time bidding with countdown timers and vertical layout
Mint NFT: Create new NFTs with image upload and golden ratio preview
Footer: Auto-scrolling sections showing recent, highest-priced, and auction NFTs, plus a real-time price chart
Design Features: All NFT cards follow the golden ratio (1:1.618), lightning effects trigger on every button click, parallax depth effects throughout, film-like smooth animations, favorites/wishlist system with heart icons, detailed modals on card click, and a back-to-top button. The UI is modern, clean, minimal, and structured for easy Web3 smart contract integration.

The application is production-ready with TypeScript, mock data for development, and comprehensive documentation in WEB3_INTEGRATION.md and README.md for connecting to Solidity smart contracts.
